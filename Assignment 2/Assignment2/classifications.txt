Among the 3 classifier algorithms used, the best one would be the IBk classifier. This is because
it has the highest percentage when it comes to correctly classified instances. This means that given
the data, the classifier was able to correctly classify the files according to their {music, speech}
types. The next best one would be the J48 classifier, followed by the Decision Table classifier.
